The house stands vacant in its green recess, Absent of beauty as a broken heart; The wild rain enters, and the sunset wind Sighs in the chambers of their loveliness, Or shakes the pane; and in the silent noons, The glass falls from the window, part by part, And ringeth faintly in the grassy stones. © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes    ',\n   'id': '959de6c2-2f6f-4ba9-a68f-1a677b1b9f04',\n   'title': '\"Under the mountain...\"'},\n  {'article': \"i carry your heart with me (i carry it in my heart) i am never without it (anywhere i go you go, my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing, my darling) \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 i fear no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet) i want no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true) and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you  here is the deepest secret nobody knows (here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows higher than soul can hope or mind can hide) and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart  i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart)  © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes     \",\n   'id': 'c1614922-eaa0-4d2f-9b95-298596ace3a0',\n   'title': 'i carry your heart with me'},\n  {'article': ' The guttersnipe and the albatross  gliding for days without a single wingbeat  were equally beyond me.  \\xa0  I yearned for the gannet\\'s strike,  the unbegrudging concentration  of the heron.  \\xa0  In the camaraderie of rookeries,  in the spiteful vigilance of colonies  I was at home.  \\xa0  I learned to distrust  the allure of the cuckoo  and the gossip of starlings,  \\xa0  kept faith with doughty bullfinches,  leveled my wit too often  to the small-minded wren  \\xa0  and too often caved in  to the pathos of waterhens  and panicky corncrakes.  \\xa0  I gave much credence to stragglers,  overrated the composure of blackbirds  and the folklore of magpies.  \\xa0  But when goldfinch or kingfisher rent  the veil of the usual,  pinions whispered and braced  \\xa0  as I stooped, unwieldy  and brimming,  my spurs\\xa0at the ready. from Sweeney Redivivus  from \"Station Island\" (1984) © by owner. provided at no charge for educational purposes    ',\n   'id': 'e4e96f6a-4b50-4089-a09c-45c081a314aa',\n   'title': 'Drifting Off'},\n  {'article': ' I imagine this midnight moment\\'s forest: Something else is alive Beside the clock\\'s loneliness And this blank page where my fingers move.
